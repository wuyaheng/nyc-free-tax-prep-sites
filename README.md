## Description
NYC Free Tax Prep Sites Map is created using React and NYC OpenData API to allow users to select a borough of interest and then see all the free tax prep sites available in the NYC map along with some additional information such as phone number, address, open-close date, income limit, if amended return service is provided or not, and whether the site accommodates walk-ins or appointments or both.
